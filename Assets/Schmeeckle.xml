        Schmeeckle Reserve is an interface between the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and the central Wisconsin community. The 280-acre natural area makes up 2/3 of the University campus. The Reserve was created to protect and restore native ecological communities, serve as an outdoor classroom for students and teachers, and provide recreational opportunities to all visitors.

        Follow the Quest or Free Roam tours to navigate through each of the ecosystems in Schmeeckle Reserve.

        The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources defines this Natural Community as, "This forest community occurs on nutrient-poor sites with excessively drained sandy or rocky soils. The primary historic disturbance regime was catastrophic fire at intervals of decades to approximately a century. Dominant trees of mature stands include jack and red pines (Pinus banksiana and P. resinosa) and/or Hill's oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis). Large acreages of this forest type were cut and burned during the catastrophic logging of the late 19th and early 20th century. Much of this land was then colonized by white birch (Betula papyrifera) and/or quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), or converted to pine plantations starting in the 1920s. Common understory shrubs are hazelnuts (Corylus spp.), early blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) and brambles (Rubus spp.); common herbs include bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinium), starflower (Trientalis borealis), barren-strawberry (Waldsteinia fragarioides), cow-wheat (Melampyrum lineare), trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens), and members of the shinleaf family (Chimaphila umbellata, Pyrola spp.). Vast acreages of open "barrens" were also planted to pine, or naturally succeeded to densely stocked "dry" forests."

        The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources defines this Natural Community as, "Inland lakes are naturally occurring bodies of standing water with a huge diversity in size, configuration, water chemistry, and biota. Their surface area can range from less than one acre to over 137,000 acres and their depth can range from less than a foot to more than 230 feet. Glaciation, post-glacial water flow, soil characteristics, topography, bedrock composition, land cover, land use and other factors can all combine to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of any given lake. The concentration of glacial kettle lakes within the Northern Highlands Ecological Landscape is globally important. Some of the lake types there are rare, and support many rare organisms.

        Natural lakes in Wisconsin frequently are classified by the source of water supply. Based on water source and outflows, four categories of lakes are commonly recognized:

        Drainage lakes: These lakes have both an inlet and outlet where the main water source is stream drainage. Most major rivers in Wisconsin have drainage lakes along their course. Drainage lakes owing one-half of their maximum depth to a dam are considered to be artificial lakes or impoundments (see Section 3.3.1.3 for information regarding impoundments/reservoirs).

        Seepage lakes: These lakes do not have an inlet or an outlet, and only occasionally overflow. As landlocked waterbodies, the principal source of water is precipitation or runoff, supplemented by groundwater from the immediate drainage area. Since seepage lakes commonly reflect groundwater levels and rainfall patterns, water levels may fluctuate seasonally. Seepage lakes are the most common lake type in Wisconsin.

        Spring lakes: These lakes have no inlet, but do have an outlet. The primary source of water for spring lakes is groundwater flowing into the bottom of the lake from inside and outside the immediate surface drainage area. Spring lakes are the headwaters of many streams and are a fairly common type of lake in northern Wisconsin.

        Drained lakes: These lakes have no inlet, but like spring lakes, have a continuously flowing outlet. Drained lakes are not groundwater-fed. Their primary source of water is from precipitation and direct drainage from the surrounding land. Frequently, the water levels in drained lakes will fluctuate depending on the supply of water. Under severe conditions, the outlets from drained lakes may become intermittent. Drained lakes are the least common lake type found in Wisconsin.

        Lakes vary based on physical characteristics, such as size, depth, configuration, chemical characteristics (such as soft versus hard water), water clarity, or the types of plant and animal life present. For example, Some lakes are almost perfectly round in shape whereas others are highly convoluted. Hard water lakes have higher levels of dissolved minerals such as calcium, iron and magnesium than soft water lakes. Some lakes, especially those near acidic wetlands such as bogs, are stained with tannic acid that leaches from surrounding vegetation. The water in these "tannin lakes" may range in color from a dark brown "coffee" color to light brown.

        These waterbodies also vary greatly in fertility and clarity, with clearer, lower fertility lakes more common in northern Wisconsin. Large, fertile, southern Wisconsin lakes with stream inlets and outlets generally have the greatest variety of species. Most lakes are dominated by cool and warmwater fishes, particularly the family Centrarchidae (sunfishes)."

        The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources defines this Natural Community as, "Black oak (Quercus velutina) is the dominant tree in this fire-adapted savanna community of xeric sites, but other oaks may also be present. Common understory species are lead plant (Amorpha canescens), black-eyed susan (Rudbeckia hirta), round-headed bush clover (Lespedeza capitata), goat's rue (Tephrosia virginiana), june grass (Koeleria cristata), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), frostweed (Helianthemum canadense), false Solomon's-seals (Smilacina racemosa and S. stellata), spiderwort (Tradescantia ohioensis), and lupine (Lupinus perennis). Distribution of this community is mostly in southwestern, central and west central Wisconsin."

        The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources defines this Natural Community as,
        "As defined by Curtis, this is an oak-dominated savanna community in which there is less than 50% tree canopy. Historically, oak openings occurred on wet-mesic to dry sites. The few extant remnants are mostly on drier sites, with the mesic and wet-mesic openings almost totally destroyed by conversion to agricultural or residential uses, and by the encroachment of other woody plants due to fire suppression. Bur, white, and black oaks (Quercus macrocarpa, Q. alba and Q. velutina) are dominant in mature stands as large, open-grown trees with distinctive limb architecture. Shagbark hickory (Carya ovata) is sometimes present. American hazelnut (Corylus americana) is a common shrub, and while the herblayer is similar to those found in oak forests and prairies, with many of the same grasses and forbs present, there are some plants and animals that reach their optimal abundance in the "openings"."

        For over 70 years, Moses Creek flowed in a drainage ditch through the eastern portion of Schmeeckle Reserve. A major restoration project in summer and fall of 2010 recreated the natural meanders of the stream and restored the historic wetland floodplain. New trails and boardwalks now provide access to the wetland, which has been planted with trees, shrubs, and marsh vegetation.
