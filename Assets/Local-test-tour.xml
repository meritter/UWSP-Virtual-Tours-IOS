       The College of Professional Studies (CPS) at UWSP was created in the early 1970s to house many of the campus's pre-professional programs. With majors in CPS as diverse as business an economics, education, interior architecture, dietetics, health sciences, health promotion, athletic training or clinical lab sciences, you may wonder what is the common thread.
  
Preparation for a profession is the answer. Pre-professional programs typically require a lot of supervised and graded practicum experiences/labs, where for instance, athletic training students actually tape ankles or education students tutor 6th graders. Practicums and labs help students to affirm their interest in the major (it is one thing to think you want to be in interior design and another to produce complicated designs for a nursing home). These hands-on experiences also help the faculty to see if the students can actually DO the job well, not just talk about it.

The college enrolls about 2,350 undergraduates and 1,200 graduate and continuing education students. Job placement or advanced graduate study in professional fields for all majors is above 94 percent.
